# Chat Room Server
Chat Room Server 
Welcome to my simple chat room application built with Python using a clientâ€“server architecture.
- The server listens for incoming client connections and relays messages between them.
- Allows clients to send messages and files in real time.
- The user interface is implemented with Tkinter, providing a basic GUI for sending and displaying messages.
